        I'm going to show you this very old-school method of making beef tips, which, once made, can be used to top lots of thingsâ€”but my favorite thing to top with tips is probably Tater Tots. And if you're looking for new ways to prepare lean, cheap, tough cuts of beef, this is one of my all-time favorite methods. You can give this an upgrade by topping with diced red onion, grated Cheddar cheese, and freshly sliced green onions, or you can serve the beef tips over hot mashed potatoes instead of tots, if you like.

        <li class="list-item">Beef round steak</li>
        <li class="list-item">Kosher salt</li>
        <li class="list-item">Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li class="list-item">Vegetable oil</li>
        <li class="list-item">Tomato paste</li>

      <h2 class="heading_secondary">Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="list-item">
          Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips; then slice these pieces, at an angle, into smaller "tips." Season beef with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">
          Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer. Let the meat sear until browned, 3 to 5 minutes, before turning over and browning the other side.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">
          Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter. Stir everything until the butter melts, and then stir in the flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">
          Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is starting to get tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class="list-item">
          Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
        </li>
